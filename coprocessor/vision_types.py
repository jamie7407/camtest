"""Shared NT4 struct definition. Keep this file IDENTICAL on the coprocessor and robot.

One VisionObservation = one camera's robot-pose estimate from one frame.
The coprocessor publishes a StructArray of these on a single topic, so the robot
does one NT read per loop no matter how many cameras there are.

Timestamping: the NT message timestamp is the publish time (NT4 converts it to the
robot's clock automatically). Each observation carries ageSeconds = publish time -
frame capture time, so the robot recovers capture time as:
    capture_time = message_time - ageSeconds
This stays correct even though each camera captures at a different instant.
